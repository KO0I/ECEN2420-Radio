\section{Antennas for Purchase}

Now turning to real manufactured antennas, the following were investigated.

\subsection{Radiowavz 40-DP11}
  Contacting the Colorado Ham Radio Outlet (HRO), I was recommended to get the
  Radiowavz 40-DP11 40M Dipole Antenna with a Balun built in. It also uses 14
  AWG wire as in my modeling of a realistic antenna. The antenna kit itself
  would require that the antenna be fed through segments of plastic or narrow
  PVC pipe in order to be set vertically.\cite{wavz}
  Cost: \$47.99
\subsection{Alpha-Delta DX40}
  These more expensive 40-meter dipole kits include built-in Surge Suppression,
  50 ft of nylon support wire and use 12 AWG wire. However, the product website
  seems to suggest that its antennas are generally to be used with a horizontal
  polarization. However, similar to the Radiowavz dipole, the DX40 could also
  be strung up vertically, albeit the provided nylon support cord would not be strong or
  abundant enough for setting up guy segments.\cite{dx40}
  Cost: \$62.95
\subsection{Comparison}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|}
    \hline
    \emph{Property} & \emph{40-DP11}  & \emph{DX40} \\
    \hline
    Cost            & \$47.99         & \$62.95\\
    Wire            & 12 AWG          & 14 AWG\\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Unfortunately, the website for the Radiowavz antenna was temporarily down,
preventing a more comprehensive comparison between the antennas.
