\section{Antenna polarization}

The polarization of a dipole is straightforward to determine; vertical dipoles
are vertically polarized and horizontal dipoles are horizontally polarized.
Revisiting Figure~\ref{fig:3dbbeamw}, it is easily seen that a vertically
polarized dipole will be largely restricted to groundwave communication, since
most of the antenna power is concentrated parallel to the ground. If skywave 
communication is desired, the dipole may be angled or bent to accomodate 
better communication; doing this will allow the antenna's power to be directed
at an angle towards the ionosphere where skywave communication can occur.
