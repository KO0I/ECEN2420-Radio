\section{Loss in a Real Coaxial Cable}

Using an RG-8/U coaxial cable, the required specifications were 
identified from a datasheet \cite{coax}.
Next, using the following formula \cite{coaxformula} can be used to approximate the characteristic
impedance:

\begin{align}
Z_0&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}}ln\frac{D}{d}
\end{align}
