\section{Impedance Variation vs Frequency}
Sampling data from between 6.3 MHz and 7.7 MHz, the length of the dipole was
set to be 48.457\% of $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ in order to acheive resonance, which
has the form:
\begin{align}
Z_A&=R_A+jX_A\\
\end{align}
Where if the reactance $X_A=0$, the antenna becomes resonant.
