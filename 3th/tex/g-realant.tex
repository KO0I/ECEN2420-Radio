\section{Effects of Real Antenna Materials}

Taking into account real matallic materials for antenna construction, two
factors need to be considered; the material itself and the diameter of the
wire.
\subsection{Material and Diameter}
A better conductor is preferable for the reduction of losses. As a result, it
seems most prudent to use Copper, which is an excellent conductor with a
conductivity $\sigma=59.6*10^6$S/m \cite{copper}.
For diamater, it appears that 14 AWG is a desirable wire thickness for its durability (with a
breaking strength rated at 550lbs from some manufacturers)\cite{wireman}
\subsection{Effects}

Compared to the ideal antenna in free space, the more realistic antenna had the
following differences at 7Mhz.Afterwards, the length of the dipole was adjusted
such that $X_A$ would be near zero again, and measurements were listed as the \emph{
Adjusted} entry in the following table. The new length was 48.4\% of $\lambda$.

  $X_A$       & 0$\Omega$         &   1.93$\Omega$  & -43.5m$\Omega$\\
  Efficiency  & 92.93\%           &  29.36\%        & 29.53\%\\
