I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be

you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

./driveramp.tex:84: LaTeX Error: Environment align* undefined.

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

./driveramp.tex:85: Misplaced alignment tab character &.
l.85   Z_C &
            = \frac{1}{\omega C} \implies C = \frac{1}{\omega Z_C\\
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

./driveramp.tex:85: Undefined control sequence.
l.85   Z_C &= \frac{1}{\omega C} \implies
                                          C = \frac{1}{\omega Z_C\\
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

Runaway argument?
{\omega Z_C\\ \text {Where } & \omega = (2\pi \cdot 7.04MHz) \approx \ETC.
./driveramp.tex:97: Paragraph ended before \frac was complete.

                   \par 
l.97 
     
I suspect you've forgotten a `}', causing me to apply this
control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?
My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
