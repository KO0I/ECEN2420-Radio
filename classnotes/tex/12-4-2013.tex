\subsection{What are mixers?}
Mixers are used to shift frequencies, combining two time-varying signals.

%   RF->(x)->IF
%        |
%       LO

Given:
\[
  f_1,f_2 \text{ mixed gives: } |(f_1-f_2)|,(f_1+f_2)
\]

\subsection{Mixing involving non-linear devices (e.g. Diodes)}

\subsection{Mixing involving linear devices but with time-varying circuits}

\section{Gilbert Cell}
All mixers used in the Norcal 40A are based on the Gilbert Cell. Belonging to
the second class of Mixers (linear devices, varying time).

\subsection{What is seen from GC?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item RF Signal is input to long-tail 
    differential amplifier pair.
  \item Collectors of $Q_1$, $Q_2$ have a set of 4
    close-connected BJTs driven by local oscillators
    $LO_{1,2}$
  \item The symmetry is altered in connecting 4
    cross-connected BJTs to the IF outputs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How does the Gilbert Cell operate?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Assume $V_{LO_1}$ is high enough such
    that $Q_3$ and $Q_5$ turn on, and that
  $V_{LO_2}$ is small enough such that 
  $Q_4$ and $Q_6$ are off.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $Q_3$,$Q_5$ works as closed switches
      \begin{enumerate}[i]
      \item \(Q_1\) is connected to $R_1$
      \item \(Q_2\) is connected to $R_2$
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Assume $V_{LO_1}$ is high enough such
    that $Q_4$ and $Q_6$ turn on, and that
  $V_{LO_1}$ is small enough such that 
  $Q_3$ and $Q_5$ are off.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $Q_4$,$Q_6$ works as closed switches
      \begin{enumerate}[i]
      \item $Q_1$ is connected to $R_2$
      \item $Q_2$ is connected to $R_1$
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overall function}
\boxed{
The overall function of the Gilbert cell is to 
multiply in the time domain
the input RF signal (at the RF frequency) by a 
square wave with value +1 or â€“1 at the LO 
frequency! This is mixing.
