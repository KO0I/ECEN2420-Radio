\section{Transmit Mixer}

Next, the Transmit Mixer was build and tested. Its schematic is shown in the
following Figure.

\subsection{Initial Set of Measurements}

All components except $C_{31}$ were soldered. Next, $C_{34}$ was adjusted to get a
max voltage %level at $\boxed{ V}$.
Next, the resonant frequency was measured across the crystal and inductor and
found to be $\boxed{4.9MHz}$

%\begin{align*}
%  f_R&=\\
%  \therefore f_R&=\boxed{}
%\end{align*}

After these final measurements, $C_{31}$ was soldered in.
